# Memory-Game
Classic game of memory

Classic game of memory in which a single user chooses two face down cards. The cards are flipped up and
if the cards are a match, the cards remain flipped up, else they are flipped back down and the user tries again.
When the first card is clicked a timer starts the game. For each pair of cards that are flipped up, the number of
player moves increases by one.  The user begins with a four star rating. Every time the user makes three unmatched
pairs, a star is removed. If at anytime the user wants to start a new game, there is a reset button. When all the cards
have been successfully flipped, there is a winner's page that denotes the player has won along with the player's star
rating. There is also a message as to how many mins/sec the game took as well as how many moves the user made.
Finally, there is a play again button if the user wishes to play again.
